"""Device-type codes reported by a Brink Flair unit (register 4004).

Register 4004 does not return the model number. It returns an opaque
*device-type* code; the Brink Modbus manual (UWA2-B/UWA2-E) describes it as
"an internal number representing the functional appliance. It has no external
value." A Flair 300, for example, reports the code ``24`` rather than ``300``.

Brink never documents these codes, so the mapping below is assembled from
unit reports rather than guessed, and is deliberately incomplete:

    Device type | Model
    ------------+--------
    24          | 300

Codes that are unknown or not yet read resolve to the most common unit, the
Flair 300, so a compatible device still works.
